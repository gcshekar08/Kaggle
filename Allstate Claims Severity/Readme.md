# Allstate Claims Severity:

### **Project Overview**

Allstate is currently developing automated methods of predicting the cost, and hence severity, of claims. In this recruitment challenge, Kagglers are invited to show off their creativity and flex their technical chops by creating an algorithm which accurately predicts claims severity. Aspiring competitors will demonstrate insight into better ways to predict claims severity for the chance to be part of Allstate&#39;s efforts to ensure a worry-free customer experience.

In this project, we will build a model to predict the cost.

### **Install**

This project requires  **Python 2.7**  and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

### **Code**

Template code is provided in the notebook `allstate_project.ipynb` notebook file.

### **Run**

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Kaggle/Allstate Claims Severity/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook allstate_project.ipynb```

```jupyter notebook allstate_project.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## **Data**

The dataset used in this project is train.csv to training and test.csv to testing the trained model which is downloaded from the link (https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/data) unzip the file to get dataset. This dataset has the following attributes:

Each row in this dataset represents an insurance claim. You must predict the value for the &#39;loss&#39; column. Variables prefaced with &#39;cat&#39; are categorical, while those prefaced with &#39;cont&#39; are continuous.
